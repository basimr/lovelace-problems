# Project Lovelace problem modules

[![Tests](https://github.com/project-lovelace/lovelace-problems/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/project-lovelace/lovelace-problems/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains modules for generating test cases (inputs and outputs) for
[Project Lovelace](http://projectlovelace.net) problems.

Note that it relies on a private solutions repository to generate solutions.
The solutions are kept private to avoid providing copy-pasteable solutions to every problem.
