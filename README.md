# Project Lovelace problem modules

This repository contains modules for generating test cases (inputs and outputs) for
[Project Lovelace](http://projectlovelace.net) problems.

Note that it relies on a private lovelace-solution repository to generate solutions.
The solutions are kept private to avoid providing copy-pasteable solutions to every
problem.
